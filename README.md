# Dotfiles

This is a collection of common dotfiles. When logging in to a new Linux
terminal, there are various settings I might want to carry over from other
machines. This repository is an encapsulation of those settings.

## Getting Started

To install these files to any new machine, perform the following steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ripvannwinkler/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
bash ~/.dotfiles/init.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
